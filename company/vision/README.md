# Vision

> **Create the best products on Earth that help people lead and learn.**

> **Access to **_**operational autonomy**_** and **_**educational opportunities**_** from anywhere in the Universe - via 'mobile tools that talk' and 'highly durable devices'.**

The world is not operated by large companies and organizations. Entrepreneurs, small business owners and local leaders make things run, day in and day out. The world is operated, not from behind desks, but on the ground, on job sites, in the streets, on the go and in the open. The "Working World" is always on its feet, relying on mobile management and computing to lead and learn. We serve these independent operators.

We recognize that around the world even children are engaged in business and forms of local leadership. Seniors and elders also play strong roles, which often go unrecognized. Our vision is to open up leadership and learning to people of any age, through a new approach to tools and technology. We call this the All Ages Agenda.
