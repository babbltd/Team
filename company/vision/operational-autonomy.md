# Operational Autonomy

> Operational autonomy can refer to the ability of a system or entity to perform tasks and make decisions independently without requiring real-time human intervention. The classical definition is much simpler: freedom of owners to operate their enterprises. Our vision is a world where both definitions of the term are possible, always with humans at the helm.
